        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p>My name is Martin Alvarez I am currently a manager at a retail paint store. I am embarking in the journey
        of learning how to code. I find coding very interesting and a very usefull skill. As our technology advances
        and new problems arise we can implement our skills to bring solutions to these problems. I hope to contribute to
        being part of the solution to our new challenges and I intend to use code as one of the tools for this endeavor.

          <p>I am in the beginning stages of learning code but I got a grasp on the fundamentals of html and I am currently
            working on improving my CSS skill. I find the creative process a very challenging and fun objective. My next goal
